## Description
PlaceToRent is the first decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) global platform in the space of both long and short-term residential and commercial rentals, such as homes, apartments, office, retail, and industrial space. We anticipate capturing real estate rental markets worldwide. While the costs and specifics of property renting/leasing may vary across the globe, both domestic and international market participants experience the same problems in the process. Inefficient property search process due to fragmented listings data, outdated rental platforms, non-transparent rental  experiences, time delays and common frustrations are just a few to name. In the light of rapid advances in technology fueled by ubiquitous broadband internet access, the reliability of data centers and improved software development tools, there developed an urgent need to revolutionize the rental process by providing a solution powered by blockchain technology that will be efficient and beneficial for all market participants including tenants and landlords worldwide. Until recently, blockchain (a digital ledger in which transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly) was most commonly referred to as the technology powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. However, rental industry participants now realize that blockchain-based smart contracts can play a much larger role in the rental market, potentially transforming property-related transactions including renting/leasing, management and rent/bill payments by means of utility tokens. This is the niche that PlaceToRent has identified and will seek to fill.
